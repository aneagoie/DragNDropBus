# DragNDropBus
simple drag and drop functionality with Javascript and Html5

A few things to note:
I used javascript instead of jQuery UI since I wanted to showcase my javascript. I threw a little bit of jQuery for fun, just for the logic portion of the program where "You're Awesome!" is calculated. 


Enjoy!
